# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Using data to understand which kickstarter campaigns were successful and why. Using the data to see whether the goal amount and time of the campaign impacted the success. 
I recommend that Louise lower her goals for her campaigns and increase the time of the campaign in order to be more successful.
